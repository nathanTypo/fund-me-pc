    // Solution for saving more gas an optimizing our contract:
    // from uint256 public minimumUsd = 50 * 1e18; --> uint256 public constant MINIMUM_USD = 50 * 1e18;
    // from address public owner; --> address public immutable i_owner;
    // We save gas because instead of story both variable into a storage slot, we store it directly into the byte code of the contract.
    //NB: they are nice gas saver if you are only setting your variable once.
    //Now we can replace our requires with custom errors.

    // 5. abi.encode / decode
    // 6. Hashing
    // 7. Yul / Assumbly.
